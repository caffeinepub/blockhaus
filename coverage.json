The section should display three tall side-by-side panels in a 3-column layout, each panel filling with a large lifestyle/product background image, a bold editorial headline overlaid on the image (e.g., 'DEFINE YOUR SPACE' for Mirrors, 'GROUND YOUR ROOM' for Rugs, 'REST YOUR HEAD' for Pillows), and a minimal outlined CTA button centered in the panel linking to the relevant category. Style the layout consistent with the Bauhaus design system: uppercase bold typography, clean borders, and the brand color palette. This is directly inspired by the uploaded reference image showing three tall image panels with headlines and category buttons.",
